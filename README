This is a simple Hangman game I've created to test my ability to design a project with my new knowledge of clean code principles (Read from a book named "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin). 
I also haven't created a new project in awhile and was itching for something to work on.

To those unfamiliar: Hangman is a simple game where the goal is to predict a word or phrase by guessing possible letters.
Each correct letter displays its position in the word or phrase, while each wrong letter adds a limb to the man. You win
if you guess every letter in the word or phrase, and you lose if all limbs are attached to the hangman!
